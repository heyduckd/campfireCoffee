        Here at campfire coffee we take our planet very seriously. Since we utilize one of earth's most precious resources to give our products the trademark taste, we make sure to give back to the earth. Over the past year we have planted over 20,000 trees all along the west coast.

        Campfire Coffee is local and has been family owned from the start. We believe that we can help grow our local economy by staying small and working close to home. Providing our friends and loved ones with the best coffee around is our main concern and everyone in the PNW is family!

      <a href="story.html"><img src="img/campsite-tent-night.jpg"></a>
      <p id="paragraph">
        Just as our name suggests, we started our brand based off of personal experience brewing coffee while camping in the great PNW. After noticing that our electronic coffee pots at home weren't producing the same tasting coffee that we had out on the trail, our founders decided they had to let the world in on their little secret. Thus, Campfire Coffee was born.
